# Traffic-Regression-Tool
A Python-based tool to determine elasticities to input independent variables using multivariate regression analysis. This tool provides an easy-to-use interface for analysts to input data, configure model parameters, and obtain statistically significant traffic forecasts with detailed elasticity reports. This tool enables analysts to run regressions on traffic time series data against user-defined independent variables and generate detailed reports on the best-fit models and their elasticities.
